# 📓 Reflection — 2026-02-15 (Sun)

## 📝 Notes

I managed to lock my laptop's BIOS, so I'm back on my old laptop; it took a while to get everything set up again.

I created the project structure and started working from PLAN.md. I wrote it with some assistance, but most of the plan comes from what I learned from clible-v1. I've been more careful this time and added more detail and context to each ticket. I'm happy with the level of abstraction, separation of concerns, and the overall structure of the project.

## 🎫 Ticket Q&A

### Ticket 0.1: Project structure and configuration — Questions & answers

<details>
  <summary><b>Q:</b> src/ vs flat layout — why does src/ prevent accidental imports?</summary>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> Python resolves imports by walking <code>sys.path</code> in order and uses the first directory that contains the requested module. The current directory is usually the first entry in <code>sys.path</code>, not something separate from it. With a <strong>flat layout</strong>, the package lives at the project root (e.g. <code>clible/</code>). When you run from the root, that directory is on <code>sys.path</code>, so <code>import clible</code> can resolve to your local tree. If the package is also installed (e.g. <code>pip install -e .</code>), you can have both the root and site-packages on <code>sys.path</code>, so the same import can point to different code depending on how and where you run. With a <strong>src layout</strong>, the package lives under <code>src/clible/</code>, so the project root does not contain a <code>clible</code> package. Running from the root, <code>import clible</code> does not resolve from the current directory. The package must be installed or <code>src</code> must be added to <code>sys.path</code> (e.g. by the test runner). There is then a single, well-defined place where <code>clible</code> is found, so you avoid accidentally importing from the wrong directory.

  <summary><b>Q:</b> pyproject.toml dependency groups (<code>[project.dependencies]</code> vs <code>[project.optional-dependencies]</code>)</summary>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> <code>[project.dependencies]</code> is for dependencies required for the project to run. <code>[project.optional-dependencies]</code> is for dependencies that are not required at runtime but used in some cases (e.g. dev, test, docs). Optional groups are installed only when requested, e.g. <code>pip install -e ".[dev]"</code>.
